# 🛡️ Sigmaid

**Emergency aid for remote communities.** > *Built for HackTUES 12 by Team Syrax.*

## 📖 About The Project

In critical moments, every second counts. **Sigmaid** is a real-time web application designed to bridge the gap between individuals in distress and emergency responders. By utilizing browser-based geolocation and a dynamic interactive map, Sigmaid allows users to broadcast their exact coordinates and relevant medical conditions instantly.

Whether in a remote village or a crowded city, Sigmaid provides a clean, panic-proof interface to get help on the map immediately.

## ✨ Key Features

* **One-Click SOS:** A highly visible, accessible emergency button that instantly grabs the user's GPS coordinates (Latitude/Longitude).
* **Live Map Visualization:** Powered by Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap, active signals are immediately plotted on a live map of Bulgaria.
* **Smart Medical Context:** Users can pre-select medical conditions (e.g., Hypertension, Heart Disease) on their profile, which are attached to their emergency signal for responders to see.
* **Emergency Categorization:** A clean modal UI allows users to specify the type of emergency (Wildfire, Flood, Health, etc.) and add custom notes before sending.
* **Dynamic Dashboard:** Real-time UI updates track the community impact, showing Total Signals, Active Emergencies, and Resolved cases without requiring a page refresh.
* **State Management:** Built-in safeguards prevent users from spamming the network, locking the UI into an "Active" state until the emergency is safely resolved.
